# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## UI 'Flow (chore tracker v1)'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

id=0%3A1&node-id=8-5&starting-point-node-id=8%3A5&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing
I took notes and some feedback from my friends and family


### Changes / Improvements

Zach- They shouldn't have to have menus pop up automatically they should be able to choose what comes up. 
I want the date finished and name to be first

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="500" height="900" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/9Vg8FbMmnnsLYVQioRkjeL/chores-v2?scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

I took notes and some feedback from my friends and family

### Changes / Improvements
Zach- having names in the home page and in each name having the chores they must do so that they don't must try and remember 

Dad- have a back button on chores page. When you click on the chore you want to do you can select the type of location/rooms. Have sub tasks for example: for vacuum, change vacuum cleaner bag if needed. For dishwasher add unstack Dishwasher or stack

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of color, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/Y9GiCIWpGITHLIwOG3j7D4/chores-v3?node-id=2001-15&p=f&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2001%3A15&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Testing

i have finished the improvements that i got from all the feedback i did

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*FIGMA IMPROVED REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*
