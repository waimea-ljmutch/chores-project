# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## UI 'Flow (chore tracker v1)'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:
